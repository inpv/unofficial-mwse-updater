# Unofficial MWSE updater
<p>An unofficial updater for <a href="https://github.com/MWSE/MWSE">Morrowind Script Extender</a> (MWSE) that just works.</p>
<p>In case you have any problems with the original updater, you can use this one.</p>
<p>Written in Python, built with PyInstaller.</p>
<p>All the required modules are bundled in the release, so you don't need Python to run the build.</p>
<p>To install drop the <code>.exe</code> file into your main Morrowind directory.</p>
